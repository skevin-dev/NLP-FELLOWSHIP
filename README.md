# NLP-FELLOWSHIP

With the support of GIZ’s Digital Transformation Center Rwanda and the FAIR Forward — Artificial Intelligence for all initiative, Huzalabs and Localis launched an NLP Fellowship for Machine Translation and AI chatbots in Rwanda. Among the leading implementation team are experts spearheading recent advances in the field such as Carnegie Mellon University professors, Prof. Patrick McSharry, RSS Fellow, and Prof. Bhiksha, IEEE Fellow.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is quickly becoming as necessary to communication in the workplace as communication itself. As players, big and small, effectively use NLP technology, we have witnessed the world enter an artificial intelligence (AI) arms race with chatbots, language translation, and voice-activated platforms.

NLP, also referred to as computational linguistics, combines linguistics with AI to enable humans to communicate with machines using natural written text. NLP powers predictive word suggestions on our mobile devices and voice-activated assistants like Siri, Bixby and Google’s voice search. It is a powerful tool and contributes significantly to the technology that many businesses produce. The technology is expected to have a vital importance in developing countries where mobile and digital penetration are growing exponentially, especially in automating and facilitating communication, especially in countries which benefit from a multilingual market such as tourism, health care, banking and financial sector etc.
